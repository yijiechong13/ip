## Week 3
- **Tool used**: Claude AI
- **Task**: Asked for recommendations on JUnit test cases for date validation.
- **Outcome**:
    - Claude suggested additional edge cases (e.g., leap years, invalid days/months,
      blank/null inputs) that I hadn’t thought of.
    - Helped me increase test coverage and confidence in my validation logic.
- **Time saved**: ~30–45 minutes.
- **Observations**:
    - The AI acted like a checklist, ensuring I didn’t overlook tricky inputs.
    - I still wrote and ran the actual tests myself.

## Week 5
- **Tool used**: Claude AI
- **Task**: Asked Claude to review my code quality and suggest improvements.
- **Outcome**:
    - Received feedback on readability and possible refactoring areas.
    - Saved ~1–2 hours as the AI highlighted areas for improvement quickly.
- **Observations**:
    - Treated the suggestions like a peer review and applied only those that made
      sense for the project.

## Week 6
- **Tool used**: ChatGPT
- **Task**: 
  1. Modified `Ui.java` so that the bot replies with the personality of Nailong
    instead of the default Duke responses.
  2. 2. Asked for suggestions on JUnit test cases to make sure date validation logic
        was fully covered.
- **Prompting strategy**:
    - Described what Nailong is (a well-known cartoon).
    - Asked ChatGPT to adapt responses to feel “Nailong-ish” and include emojis for a
      cuter tone.
    - For tests, prompted it to list tricky or edge-case dates I should cover.
- **Outcome**:
    - ChatGPT generated responses that matched the Nailong personality more clearly
      than if I had written them manually.
    - Responses included emoji, making them more playful and consistent with the
      desired style.
- **Time saved**: ~1 hour in total. 
- **Observations**:
    - ChatGPT was good at capturing the playful style I wanted.
    - I still had to review and tweak some lines to make sure the wording fit the
      project’s tone.
    - ChatGPT was helpful for both style and test coverage, but I still validated
         everything manually before committing.
